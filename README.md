Many elements affect the expenses of medical insurance and it becomes quite tough to predict those expenses due to the variability of those elements. A regression model has been used to recognize and study a complex sample that enables us to predict the price of medical 
insurance.
Regression is a technique for  investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. Itâ€™s used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.
